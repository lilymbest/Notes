## Classes in Python

### Review of OOP
___
Python is an Object Oriented Programming(OOP) language.

**OOP** - Object Oriented Progamming is characterized by programming with `objects` that represent real-world objects of the application.

Example: A book would have a book object with all its properties and methods.

Objects bundle related properties (attributes) and methods (behavior) together. This is the encapsulation priciple in OOP.

In an OOP language, classes are used to create objects. We instantiate a class to obtain an instance (object) of that class.
