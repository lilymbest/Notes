# Python
---
**Python** - A scripting language that was started in December 1989 and released in 1991 by Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum.

- Python is a high-level interpreted programming language designed for writing applications where programmers don't have to worry about memeory management. [Python Packet Index](https://pypi.org/)

## Python syntax 
---
Designed to be more readable by using more english key words then symbols. && = and in python. 

- Uses indentation to define blocks of code.
- Comments are defined with # and anything after it will not run. Multiline coments use tripple quotes(""") or a # on each line
- Naming a class and a variabe may have different case types (snake case camel case etc...).
- Boolean values are uppercase
---
## Data Types
---
- <class 'int'> = 25
- <class 'str'> = 'string'
- <class 'bool'> = True
- <class 'float'> = 3.14159
- <class 'complex'> = 3+4j
- <class 'NoneType'> = None
---
## Math Operations
---
- (+)
- (-)
- (*)
- (/)
- (%)
- (**)

Note: Increment Operators Do not exist in python (++), (--).

--- 
## Converting Between Data Types
---
- str(item)
- int(item, base)
- float(item)
- hex(int)
- oct(int)
- tuple(item)
- list(item)
- dict(item)

Ex. str(5) = '5'

---
## Python Built in Functions
---
- len() = length
Ex. len("texas") = 5
---
## Control Flow
---
Control Flow - the order in which code executes in a program.

---
## Truthy & Falsey
---
False
- False
- None
- Zero (In any numeric type)
- Empty sequences or collections 
    - '' (Empty String) 
    - [] (Empty list)
    - () (Empty Tuple)
    - {} (Empty Dictionary)
    - range(0) (Empty Range)
---
## Logical Operators
---
- or = || (If the first operand is truthy, return it, otherwise return the second operand)

- and = && (If the first operand is falsey, return it, otherwise return the second operand)
---
## Comparison Operators
---
- (<) - Less than
- (>) - Greater Than
- (<=) - Less than or equal to
- (>=) - Greater than or equal to
- (==) - Equal to
- (!=) - Not equal to
